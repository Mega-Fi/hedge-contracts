# Hegic Protocol - Project Overview

## What is Hegic?

Hegic is a decentralized, on-chain options trading protocol built on Ethereum and Arbitrum. It allows users to:
- **Buy options**: Purchase call/put options and complex strategies without KYC
- **Provide liquidity**: Earn premiums by providing capital to underwrite options
- **Stake tokens**: Provide backstop coverage through the Cover Pool

## Project Type

- **Lerna Monorepo**: Multiple packages managed with Lerna and Yarn workspaces
- **Smart Contract Protocol**: Written in Solidity for EVM-compatible blockchains
- **DeFi Options Platform**: Decentralized financial derivatives

## Package Purposes

### 1. **v8888** (Legacy/Original)
- Released: August 10, 2021
- Original Hegic protocol implementation
- Features: Basic options, liquidity pools, staking
- Status: Maintained for backwards compatibility

### 2. **herge** (Current Version)
- Latest protocol upgrade
- Enhanced features: Inverse strategies, improved treasury
- Better risk management with Cover Pool
- Audited by PeckShield

### 3. **hardcore-beta** (Experimental)
- Testing ground for new features
- Depends on v8888 and utils
- Used for deployment testing
- Not for production use

### 4. **utils** (Shared Library)
- Common contracts used across packages
- Math libraries, ERC standards, mocks
- No deployment scripts

## Key Innovation

Unlike traditional options exchanges with order books:
- **Instant execution**: No waiting for counterparty
- **Pool-based**: Liquidity providers collectively underwrite options
- **On-chain settlement**: Automatic payoffs via smart contracts
- **Tokenized positions**: Options and LP positions as NFTs

## Target Networks

- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Primary deployment
- **Arbitrum**: L2 deployment for lower gas costs
- **Ropsten**: Historical testnet (deprecated)
